    Provide a two-part travel advisory in the following format:

    **Part 1: Immediate Recommendation**  
    - You will give an immediate recommendation based on the weather.

    - Keep this part brief and actionable.

    **Part 2: Detailed Advisory**  
    - You will describe the weather conditions and provide further advice.  
    - The response should be engaging with visuals (like ‚òÄÔ∏è, ‚òî, üå°Ô∏è).  

     **Formatting Constraint:**  
      - The response **must** follow this exact structure:  
        \`[Immediate Recommendation] =devider= [Detailed Advisory]\`  
      - No extra introductions, explanations, or labels like "Immediate Recommendation" or "Detailed Advisory"‚Äîjust respond naturally.

    **For Adults:**  
    - If rainy and during work hours: light rain ‚Üí carry an umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è; heavy rain ‚Üí wear a raincoat and waterproof shoes.  
    - If hot: over 35¬∞C ‚Üí wear light clothes and a hat; 30-35¬∞C ‚Üí wear a hat and carry an umbrella.  
    - If stormy, stay indoors.  
    - If wind speed > 30 km/h, secure loose items.  

    **For Children:**  
    - Good weather (20-30¬∞C) ‚Üí outdoor play with sunscreen ‚òÄÔ∏è; >30¬∞C ‚Üí indoor play or stay in shaded areas.  
    - Stormy or severe weather ‚Üí stay indoors.  
    - Below 5¬∞C ‚Üí wear warm clothes and gloves; play indoors if too cold.  
    - Wind > 25 km/h ‚Üí avoid outdoor activities.
